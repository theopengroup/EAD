0.2.0 2011-11-13)
 - Fixed hashing to use md5 hash and change the bit computation to pass
   accuracy test.                                                        [BUG]

   likely numbers in log(n) time.

0.1.18 2010-10-25)
 - Fixed issue #5, wherein a call to open() returning an invalid fd would
   cause a seg fault.                                                     [BUG]

0.1.12 2010-4-5)
 - Added __len__ which gives a good estimate of how many elements were

0.1.10 2010-4-2)
 - Added MANIFEST so that building distributions works [FEATURE]
 - Restructured docs so that html is a symlink to the _build/html directory [FEATURE]

   be compared correctly.
